# FriendWagon

FriendWagon is a web application that allows users to host road trips or join others on road trips. FriendWagon was built at BrickHack, a hackathon hosted at RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology). You can view the ChallengePost project [here](http://challengepost.com/software/friendwagon). FriendWagon runs on Node.js and uses the Google Maps API to plot the route and search for trips that may intersect the user's desired destination.

## Awards

FriendWagon was awarded "Best Use of AWS" at BrickHack.

## Inspiration

People are moving all the time, and a lot of the time it's to the same place. We made a service that allows people to easily and efficiency find road trips headed home, the beach, or anywhere else.

## How it works

Users can either create a road trip or search for trips departing soon. We take the info the user provides and check it with our database to present them with the road trips that match their criteria. The site then creates a page for the trip that shows the route, the users that are attending, and a Spotify playlist of songs that overlap in the riders' libraries, so that everyone will enjoy the music.
